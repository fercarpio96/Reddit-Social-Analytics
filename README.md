The main objective of this paper is to describe the process, analysis, and implementation of NLP (Natural Language Processing) on social media. 
The task consisted in getting access to reddit and from there gather the information of a subreddit forum, in this case called “r/politics”, 
with focus in domestic politics in the USA.
